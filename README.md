# VIRUS.EXE
Receipt Reader Application using C++


Visual Instrument for Recording User Spending - VIRUS.EXE

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was better understand optical character recognition and how it can be applied to real world scenarios. We decided that we will do OCR in order to try and determine the total amount spent in a store from a receipt. This would be useful because most people will like to keep track of their spending habits and this can be diffcult to do. <br>
With this software, it can assist in reusing the amount of time taken to do this making the software identify the amount spend by reading it from a simple image of a receipt and recording it for the user. 

## User Inferface of the Application
We used wxWidgets that allows us to simply the way Visual Studio does GUI with C++. <br>
The first image is a template on how the UI looks when it is first open to the user.
